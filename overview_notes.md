## Terms
- population: all of the items _we are interested in_
    - Example: Darden Cohort Students is a population of students in Darden cohort
    - Example: All the Codeup Data Science Students past and present. Ada, Bayes, Curie, Darden
    - Example: All the people on planet Earth studying Data Science
- analytics means answering questions with certainty about the population
- sample: a subset of the population (hopefully representative)
- observation means one single thing we're observing from that population
- stastistic: a measurement of a sample (for purpose of trying to understand the population)

If we say, The Darden Cohort is our population.

We get to decide what the population is.
Why?
The Population is what's interesting.
The population, the whole population, and nothing but the population.

What is an "observation" if the Darden Corhort is our population?
A single student in the Darden Cohort

Analyltics = we're answering questions with all the data
(Digestion of) Statistics = we're uncertain about the entire population

If we say, the population is every single student on Planet Earth learning Data Science...
It's unfeasible to capture all the data here..
This is why we make "samples" of the population
We try to understand the entire population through samples

And we need/want those samples to as representative of the population as possible.
That's what stats is...

Samples are segments of the population
Can be very challenging for our observations in the sample to be representative..

Emailing a survey to the group...
- not everybody responds
- not everybody has an email
- not every response is always accurate (self reporting bias)

Questions from y'all so far?
- How ‘good’ does data have to be in order to be valid? To what degree of unbiased does it need to be ]
    - Depends on the scenario
    - We don't have a clear, clean answer like 7/9 times. 
    - Even 99.999% might not be good enough (depends)

- Difference between bias and error? 
    - Bias is all the ways our sample could be non-representative or under/over representative the population
    - How can we measure bias? If we test our methods on data where we have population information..
    - Error is difference between predicted/expected and actual data
    - Even with an entire population, our models may produce error

- The goal is to understand what the sampling biases ARE, and your awareness is how you evaluate your sample and you ask yourself, "Am I violating any of these biases"

- Biases come up big time with building research programs or even small surveys
- Knowing your domain, knowing your city if you're doing city level research

- Big goal with sampling is to get a sample that looks like the population
- If data in a sample does not represent the population,
    - biases (any mixture)
    - size of the sample usually way too small
